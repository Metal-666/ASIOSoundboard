This is a small checklist that should be completed before doing a pull request from 'beta' to 'main'. I write this mostly for myself because I'll probably be the only person doing stuff on the main branch. If you want to contribute then it's probably better if you open a pull request to 'beta' branch (see the other template).

# Checklist:

- [ ] Comments where added to explain what the new code does
- [ ] Imports where fixed, cleaned and organized
- [ ] Code was formatted (Dart code should be auto-formatted and C# code should be manually formatted by me), commented-out code and unused classes/functions removed (unless they are going to be used in the future)
- [ ] The project is building and running fine
- [ ] There are no warnings from Dart and C# compilers
